### Useful thank words

Finally I just wanted to say how proud I am of the whole group. The meeting in Sedona last week really showed that we’re leading the world in what we do (as shown by Debra’s award which I just found out about!!!) and this is solely because of the work that you do. Thanks again for everything! I’ll talk to you all soon!
